    <p>Quartz is a material research project that unites state of the art computer-aided rapid prototyping technology with silica glass—one of the most versatile material compounds used for millennia. Using open source CNC hardware and software, this extrusion
      process aims for a novel computer-aided design approach to form two- and three-dimensional glass artifacts that benefit from the material’s toughness, optical quality, and thermal stability.

      The photo on the top shows the modified CNC Machine in its current stage. It can extrude simple geometries with consistent thickness and high fidelity based on a CAD drawing. The project documentation is available [here](http://quartzdesign.io).
