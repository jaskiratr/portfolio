JB1.0: Jamming Bodies is an immersive installation that transforms Storefront's gallery space into a laboratory. It collapses architecture, technology, and art into a single object. While skin usually demarcates the transition between exterior and interior, this experimental installation transforms skin into a membrane that operates as both.

	As the walls deflate, they become hard. Inflate them, and they are soft. The result over time is a pulsating room that can be tuned for stiffness, reconfigured on demand and which confuses the distinction between our skin and our walls.
