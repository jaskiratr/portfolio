Post from the Past is a mysterious monthly subscription-box service that personally connects you with spies, vikings, pirates and other historical humans - everyone from great leaders to everyday people from a different time.

This Trans-Media Design Project was the winner of A+E Networks Design Jam at Parsons School of Design. It also won the the _[NYC Media Lab Combine Challenge 2016](http://www.thecombine.nyc/)_.

Team : Bryan Collinsworth, Shakti MB, Joanna Chin, Jaskirat Randhawa
